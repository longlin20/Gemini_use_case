A linked list is an ordered sequence of nodes. Each node stores a piece of data called info and a reference pointing to the next node in the list. The nodes do not need to be in consecutive memory positions.
"The diagram shows a linked list with three nodes. The first node contains the value ""info"" and a reference to the next node. The second node also contains the value ""info"" and a reference to the next node"
". The third node contains the value ""info"" and a reference to null, indicating the end of the list. The variable ""first"" points to the first node in the list."

". It has two attributes: info, which stores the actual data of type E, and next, which is a reference to the next node in the structure. The class has a constructor that takes an argument of type E and initializes the info attribute"
". Additionally, there are getters and setters for both attributes: getNext and setNext for the next node, and getInfo and setInfo for the info attribute."

Inserting a node at the beginning
"The image describes the second step in the process of inserting a node at the beginning of a linked list. The code snippet ""public void insert(E info)"" shows the method signature for the insertion operation"
". The diagram illustrates the linked list with three existing nodes. Each node is represented by a rectangle with an oval inside. The leftmost rectangle is labeled ""first"" indicating the head of the linked list"
". The ovals inside the rectangles represent the data stored in each node. An arrow pointing to the right connects each node to its next node. The last node's arrow points to the text ""null"" indicating the end of the list."

". This step is represented by the code ""newNode.setNext(first);"" and visually by an arrow from the new node to the ""first"" node."

**3. Inserting at an intermediate position (given the previous node)**

5. Inserting at an intermediate position (given the position)
We see a code snippet that shows how to insert an element into a linked list at a given position. The code first checks if the position is 0 or if the linked list is empty
". If either of these conditions is true, the code inserts the element at the beginning of the list. Otherwise, the code inserts the element at the specified position."
"There is also a diagram that shows a linked list with five nodes. The first node is labeled ""first"" and the last node is labeled ""null"". The third node is colored red. An arrow points from the word ""previous"" to the second node in the list"
.  The diagram is meant to illustrate the process of inserting a new node into the linked list at a given position. The red node represents the new node that is being inserted.
"**5. Inserting at an intermediate position (given the position)**
The image shows a slide titled ""5. Inserting at an intermediate position (given the position)""."
The code snippet shows the implementation of the insert method in Java. The method takes two arguments: the information to be inserted (info) and the position where it should be inserted (pos).
"The code first checks if the position is larger than the number of nodes in the list. If it is, the new node is inserted at the end of the list. Otherwise, the code advances from the first node to the position of the previous node"
". Once the previous node is found, the code calls the insert method, passing the information to be inserted and the previous node as arguments."
"There is a diagram representing a linked list. The first node is on the left and the last node is on the right. The nodes are represented by rectangles. The first node is labeled ""first"" and the last node is labeled ""null"""
". The second node from the left is colored red. An arrow points from the text ""previous"" to the node before the red node."
This diagram illustrates the process of inserting a new node at a given position in a linked list. The red node represents the new node to be inserted
. The red node represents the new node to be inserted. The code first finds the node before the position where the new node should be inserted (represented by the arrow pointing to the node before the red node)
". Then, the new node is inserted after the previous node."
6. Extracting an intermediate node (given the position)
We have a piece of code that extracts an element from a linked list given its position. The code is a method called extract which takes an integer called pos as an argument
". If the position is 0 or the linked list is empty, then the element is extracted at the beginning of the list, calling the method extract without arguments. There is a diagram showing a linked list with 5 elements"
". There is a diagram showing a linked list with 5 elements. The third element is red, indicating that it is the element to be extracted. The second element is labeled ""previous"" and the first element is labeled ""first"". The last node points to null."
Extracting an intermediate node (given the position)
"We have some code and a diagram. The code is for a method called ""extract"" which takes an integer ""pos"" as input. The diagram shows a linked list with 5 nodes"
". The diagram shows a linked list with 5 nodes. The first node is labeled ""first"", the third node is colored red, and the last node's next pointer points to ""null"""
". An arrow points from the label ""previous"" to the second node, and an arrow points from the label ""first"" to the first node."
"The code first checks if the position is larger than the number of nodes. If it is, then null is returned. Otherwise, the code advances from the first node to the position of the previous node"
". Then, the code calls the method that extracts at an intermediate position given the previous node."
"7. Traversing the list: printing the content
We have some source code that shows a function called print. This function takes no arguments. The code is as follows:
```java
public void print() {
  if (first != null) {
    Node<E> current = first;"
"if (first != null) {
    Node<E> current = first;
    while (current != null) {
      System.out.println(current.getInfo());
      current = current.getNext();
    }
  }
}
```"
"Along with the code, there is a diagram that helps to explain how the code works. The diagram shows a linked list with five nodes. The first node is labeled ""first"" and the last node is labeled ""null"". Each node is represented by a rectangle"
". Each node is represented by a rectangle. The rectangles are connected by arrows, which indicate the order of the nodes in the list. The first arrow points to the first node in the list, and the last arrow points to null"
". There is also an arrow labeled ""current"" that points to the first node."
"The code works by first checking if the list is empty. If the list is not empty, the code creates a variable called ""current"" and sets it to the first node in the list. The code then enters a loop that continues as long as the ""current"" node is not null"
". Inside the loop, the code prints the information stored in the ""current"" node. The code then sets the ""current"" node to the next node in the list"
". The loop continues until the ""current"" node is null, which indicates that the end of the list has been reached."
"**8. Traversing the list: searching for the last node**
 a method written in Java that searches for the last node in a linked list.
The method is called `searchLastNode()` and it returns a `Node<E>` object."
The method starts by declaring a `Node<E>` variable called `current` and initializing it to the `first` node in the list.
"Then, it checks if `current` is not `null`. If it is not, it enters a `while` loop that iterates through the list until it finds a node whose `next` node is `null`."
"Inside the loop, the `current` node is updated to the next node in the list by calling the `getNext()` method.
Once the loop has finished, the `current` node will be the last node in the list, so the method returns the `current` node."
"**9. Traversing the list: searching for a piece of data**
 a piece of code that defines the method *search* that traverses a linked list to search for a specific piece of data."
The method takes as input a parameter *info* of generic type *E* representing the data to be searched
". It uses a *current* node reference to traverse the list, initialized to the *first* node, and a counter *pos* to keep track of the position of the node in the list."
The traversal is done in a *while* loop that iterates as long as the *current* node is not null and the information stored in the *current* node is not equal to the *info* we are looking for
". For each iteration, the counter *pos* is incremented and the *current* node is moved to the next one."
"If the loop terminates because the *current* node is not null, it means that the *info* has been found and the method returns the value of the counter *pos*. Otherwise, the *info* is not in the list and the method returns *-1*."

We see the code for a selection sort algorithm in Java. The first function *selectionSort* takes an integer array as input. It iterates through the array with two nested for loops
". It iterates through the array with two nested for loops. The outer loop iterates through each element of the array, while the inner loop iterates through the remaining unsorted subarray to find the minimum element"
". The index of the minimum element is stored in the variable *m*. After the inner loop completes, the function swaps the element at index *i* with the element at index *m*."
The second function *swap* takes an integer array and two integer indices as input. It swaps the elements at the given indices using an auxiliary variable *aux*.
There are some alternative implementations for this algorithm listed on the slide. The external loop could iterate up to the second to last element of the array
". The internal loop could iterate from *j+1* to the end of the array, which would save one unnecessary comparison. The algorithm could be modified to sort in descending order by changing the comparison in the if statement to *a[j] > a[m]*"
". Finally, unnecessary swaps could be avoided by adding a condition to the swap function to only swap if *i* is not equal to *m*."

". The method first initializes three integer variables: `i` to `l+1`, `j` to `r`, and `p` to `a[l]`. The variable `p` represents the pivot element. The method then enters a `while` loop that continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `j`"
". Inside the loop, the method compares the value of `a[i]` with `p`. If `a[i]` is less than or equal to `p`, the method increments `i`. Otherwise, it compares `a[j]` with `p`. If `a[j]` is greater than `p`, the method decrements `j`"
". If `a[j]` is greater than `p`, the method decrements `j`. If neither of these conditions is true, the method swaps the elements at indices `i` and `j` using the `swap` method and then increments `i` and decrements `j`"
". After the loop completes, the method swaps the elements at indices `l` and `j` using the `swap` method and then returns the value of `j`."
"The `swap` method takes three arguments: an integer array `a`, and two integers `i` and `j` representing the indices of the elements to be swapped. The method first declares an integer variable `aux` and assigns it the value of `a[i]`"
. The method then assigns the value of `a[j]` to `a[i]` and the value of `aux` to `a[j]`.
The code also includes two comments that explain the logic of the `partition` method. The first comment explains that the method compares the elements of the array with the pivot element `a[l]`
". When the method finds an element that is higher than the pivot element on the left side of the array and an element that is lower than the pivot element on the right side of the array, it swaps these two elements"
". The second comment explains that before the method finishes, the pivot element must be placed in its correct location, which is done by swapping the elements at indices `l` and `j`."

". These algorithms have an average complexity of O(n log n), which means that they are efficient with many elements. However, they are more complex to code. With the exception of merge sort, they use little memory."
"Bubble Sort. Two loops
The image describes the Bubble Sort algorithm, which uses two loops."
"The external loop iterates length of array - 1 times. In each iteration, one element is sorted, except for the last one in which two elements are sorted. The range of the index in the external loop is from 0 to length of array - 1."
"The internal loop iterates a different number of times depending on the iteration of the external loop. In the first iteration of the external loop, the internal loop iterates length of array - 1 times"
". In the second iteration of the external loop, the internal loop iterates length of array - 2 times. In the m-th iteration of the external loop, the internal loop iterates length of array - i - 1 times"
. The range of the index in the internal loop is from 0 to length of array - 1 - i.
"After the m-th iteration of the external loop, the elements from index 0 to length of array - 2 - i are unsorted, and the elements from length of array - 1 - i to length of array - 1 are sorted."
"Bubble Sort. Conclusions
The image shows a slide titled ""Bubble Sort. Conclusions"" that lists the advantages and drawbacks of the bubble sort algorithm.
Advantages:
- Little additional memory is needed
- Few lines of code"
"- Little additional memory is needed
- Few lines of code
- Efficient for arrays with few elements
Drawbacks:
- Inefficient for arrays with many elements
  - O(n²) => quadratic order (two nested loops for an array of n elements)"
"- For a given array there are always the same number of iterations (even though it is already sorted), even though there are no swaps
  - Too many swaps"
"- Too many swaps
- Larger elements move faster to the end (they can reach the end in one iteration of the external loop), but lower elements move slower to the beginning (they gain one position per iteration)"
- Improvement: Cocktail sort (double internal loop to pass from left to right and from right to left in each iteration of the external loop)
Selection Sort. Two loops
"We are going to see how the selection sort algorithm works. This algorithm uses two loops. The external loop iterates over the array, and in each iteration, one element is sorted"
". The number of iterations is equal to the length of the array, although the last iteration is not strictly needed. The range of the index in the external loop goes from zero to the length of the array minus one"
". The internal loop searches for the minimum or maximum value in the array. In the first iteration of the external loop, the internal loop iterates from zero to the length of the array minus one"
". In the second iteration of the external loop, the internal loop iterates from one to the length of the array minus two, and so on. In the m-th iteration of the external loop, the internal loop iterates from m minus one to the length of the array minus m"
". The range of the index in the internal loop goes from i, the index of the external loop, to the length of the array minus one"
". After the m-th iteration of the external loop, the elements from zero to i are sorted, and the elements from i plus one to the length of the array minus one are unsorted."
"Selection Sort. Conclusions
 the advantages, drawbacks and variants of the Selection Sort algorithm.
The advantages are:
- Little additional memory is needed
- Few lines of code
- Efficient for arrays with few elements
The drawbacks are:"
"- Efficient for arrays with few elements
The drawbacks are:
- Inefficient for arrays with many elements
- O(n^2) which means it's quadratic order because it uses two nested loops for an array of n elements"
"- For a given array there are always the same number of iterations, even though it is already sorted and even though there are no swaps
- However, there are much less swaps than with Bubble Sort
Variant:"
"Variant:
- Placing the maximum or minimum at the end, instead of placing the maximum or minimum at the beginning"
Insertion Sort. Two loops
"the two loops used in insertion sort. The external loop iterates over the array, with the number of iterations equal to the length of the array. In each iteration, one element is sorted, including the last iteration"
. The range of the index in the external loop is from 0 to the length of the array minus 1. The internal loop finds the correct position to insert the element
". The number of iterations in the internal loop depends on the position ""advanced"" by the element which is inserted. If the element inserted moves k positions to the left, then there are k elements that are moved one position to the right"
". After the m-th iteration (i=m-1) of the external loop, the elements from 0 to i are sorted and the elements from i+1 to the length of the array minus 1 are unsorted."
"Insertion Sort. Conclusions
The image shows a slide titled ""Insertion Sort. Conclusions"" about the advantages and disadvantages of using insertion sort.
Advantages:
- Little additional memory is needed
- Few lines of code"
"- Little additional memory is needed
- Few lines of code
- Efficient for arrays with few elements"
"- More efficient than Selection Sort for partially sorted arrays because for a given array there are always the same number of iterations in the external loop, even though it is already sorted, but the internal loop is adaptable.
Drawbacks:"
"Drawbacks:
- Inefficient for arrays with many elements because its time complexity is O(n^2), which means it has a quadratic order with two nested loops for an array of n elements.
- Inefficient when the array to sort is in reverse sorted order."
"Heap Sort. Conclusions
We can see the advantages and drawbacks of using heap sort.
Heap sort is efficient for arrays with many elements, even in the worst case, with O(n log n) complexity.
Also, little additional memory is needed."
"Also, little additional memory is needed.
On the other hand, heap sort has a complex code."
"Merge Sort. Recursive division and merging with auxiliary array
The image describes the Merge Sort algorithm."
"The first step of the algorithm is the recursive division: Given an array, or part of it, with *l* as the first position, *r* as the last position, and *m* as the half position calculated as *(l+r)/2*"
", and *m* as the half position calculated as *(l+r)/2*, divide the array recursively in two until *l* and *r* are equal"
. The two parts are from *l* to *m* and from *m+1* to *r*.
"The second step is sorting by merging subarrays: Create an auxiliary array containing the two subarrays to sort, then compare the elements to sort each subarray."
"Finally, it is important to note that elements are not in their final correct position until we finish merging subarrays."
"Merge Sort. Conclusions
There are two main advantages of using merge sort: it is efficient for arrays with many elements, even in the worst case, with a time complexity of O(n log n), and it is highly parallelizable."
"The drawbacks are that it requires complex code and more memory space to store auxiliary variables, such as an auxiliary array."
"Quick Sort. Recursive partition and sorting by swapping
The image describes the Quick Sort algorithm, which uses recursive partition and sorting by swapping."
"Step 1: Recursive partition. Given an array, or part of it, with *l* the first position and *r* the last position, we have to run an algorithm that tells us where to do the partition"
". The elements on the left should be lower than the pivot, and the elements on the right should be higher than the pivot. The next partition is computed recursively."
"Step 2: Sorting by swapping. Moving forward from the left, and from the right, comparing with the pivot and swapping as needed. Placing the pivot in its correct location.
Finally, it states that pivots are always placed in their final sorted position."
"Quick Sort. Conclusions
We can see a list of advantages and drawbacks of the Quick Sort algorithm."
"Advantages are: it is very efficient for arrays with many elements, its performance is O(n log n), although the worst case is O(n^2). It requires little additional memory and it is highly parallelizable.
The main drawback is that it requires complex code."

The first method is length(). This method returns the length of a string. It's important to remember to include the parentheses after the method name, as this is how Java knows that it is a method call."
The next method is charAt(). This method allows you to access individual characters inside a string. You pass in the position of the character you want to access as an argument to the method. The first position in a string is 0.
The final method discussed is substring(). This method returns a reference to a new string that is a substring of the original string
. The substring() method takes two arguments: the first position included in the substring and the first position excluded from the substring.

"useful methods of the String class.
The first method is length(). This method returns the length of a string. It's important to remember to include the parentheses after the method name, as this is how Java knows that it is a method call."
The next method is charAt(). This method allows you to access individual characters inside a string. You pass in the position of the character you want to access as an argument to the method. The first position in a string is 0.
The final method discussed is substring(). This method returns a reference to a new string that is a substring of the original string
. The substring() method takes two arguments: the first position included in the substring and the first position excluded from the substring.

What is an array?
"An array is a set of elements belonging to the same data type and stored in one place. The index operator, represented by square brackets, is used to retrieve individual elements from the array"
. The length attribute returns the number of elements in the array. It's important to note that this should not be confused with the length method of the String class.
"The range of the index starts from 0 and goes up to length minus 1. It's crucial to be careful not to exceed the maximum length of the array, as doing so will result in an IndexOutOfBoundsException.

Declaration is the process of assigning an identifier to the array and specifying the data type of the elements that will be stored. This can be done in two ways:- Type ArrayName();
- Type [] ArrayName;"
"- Type [] ArrayName;
No memory is allocated to store the array during the declaration. Therefore, you cannot access its contents yet."
"Creation consists of allocating memory for the array. You must use the reserved word ""new"" and specify the array size. For example:
arrayName [] = new type [arraySize];"
"arrayName [] = new type [arraySize];
Once the array is created, its elements have default values until the array is initialized. The default values are as follows:

- String = null"
"- float, double = 0.0
- booleans = false

how arrays work. The index of the first element in an array is zero. The index of the last element in an array is the array length minus one. The index can be any integer expression that evaluates to a value between zero and the array length minus one

"Arrays
Homework
• Write a program that multiplies twobi-dimensional arrays of integers"
What is an array?
"An array is a set of elements belonging to the same data type and stored in one place. The index operator, represented by square brackets, is used to retrieve individual elements from the array"
. The length attribute returns the number of elements in the array. It's important to note that this should not be confused with the length method of the String class.
"The range of the index starts from 0 and goes up to length minus 1. It's crucial to be careful not to exceed the maximum length of the array, as doing so will result in an IndexOutOfBoundsException.
Declaration, Creation, Initialization"
"Declaration, Creation, Initialization
 how to declare, create, and initialize arrays."
"how to declare, create, and initialize arrays.
Declaration is the process of assigning an identifier to the array and specifying the data type of the elements that will be stored. This can be done in two ways:- Type ArrayName();
- Type [] ArrayName;"
"- Type [] ArrayName;
No memory is allocated to store the array during the declaration. Therefore, you cannot access its contents yet."
"Creation consists of allocating memory for the array. You must use the reserved word ""new"" and specify the array size. For example:
arrayName [] = new type [arraySize];"
"arrayName [] = new type [arraySize];
Once the array is created, its elements have default values until the array is initialized. The default values are as follows:
- int, short, long = 0
- float, double = 0.0
- booleans = false
- String = null"
"- float, double = 0.0
- booleans = false
- String = null
- Object = null"
how arrays work. The index of the first element in an array is zero. The index of the last element in an array is the array length minus one. The index can be any integer expression that evaluates to a value between zero and the array length minus one
". The example array has ten elements. The values of the elements are: -7, 0, 3, 8, 5, -4, 6, 6, 1, and 2."
"Memory usage in array declaration
We have two arrays declared: an array of integers and an array of points. Both arrays are declared but not initialized."

Notes to remember
- Unary operators:  -  ""i++"" first evaluates then increments.
  - ""++i"" first increments then evaluates."
"- ""++i"" first increments then evaluates.
  - Example: if i equals 3, ""a equals i++"" results in a equals 3, while ""a equals ++i"" results in a equals 4.
- Binary operators can be abbreviated: ""x+=3"" equals to ""x = x+3"".
- Assignment vs. comparison:"
"- Assignment vs. comparison:
  - The ""="" operator assigns a value. Example: ""var = 5"" assigns 5 to the variable var.
  - The ""=="" operator compares. Example: ""var == 5"" returns true after the previous assignment."

The objective of this scenario is to be fluent in reading Java structures related to classes, attributes, and methods. The goal is to be able to understand, at a glance, a complex Java program with several files."
"The work plan for this scenario is as follows:
- Review Java syntax, including identifiers, reserved words, etc., in order to distinguish between words from the Java language and naming conventions for a specific application."
"- Identify language structures related to class declaration, attribute declaration (both basic and reference types), and method declaration."
"- Draw class diagrams to represent a set of Java files in order to identify object types, their characteristics (attributes), and behaviors (methods)."
"- Understand and explain the main method (if it exists) to see the order in which objects are created, methods are called, and sentences are executed."
"This scenario involves a first meeting as a programmer in one hour. By that time, the code should be reviewed and understood, including how the application works."
How to represent classes and objects in Java
"the concepts related to classes and objects in Java. These concepts are: class declaration, attribute declaration, method declaration, object creation, identifiers, reserved words, primitive and reference types."
"Strings Declaration, concatenation
- A sequence of characters implemented in a class named String in java.lang package.
- Strings creation:
  - String emptyS = new String();
  - String emptyS = """";
  - String message = ""hello"""
"- String emptyS = """";
  - String message = ""hello""
  - String messageCopy = message;
- Strings concatenation:
  - String concatenation uses the overloaded + operator.
  - ""this"" + ""that"" // result: ""thisthat""
  - ""abc"" + 5 // result: ""abc5"""
"- ""abc"" + 5 // result: ""abc5""
  - ""a"" + ""b"" + ""c"" // result: ""abc""
  - ""a"" + 1 + 2 // result: ""a12""
  - 1 + 2 + ""a"" // result: ""3a""
  - 1 + (2 + ""a"") // result: ""12a"""
Strings Comparison
"- You must not use relational operators such as less than, greater than, less than or equal to, and greater than or equal to, nor the equality operators such as equal to and not equal to with Strings. These operators compare the object, not the content."
"- There are specific methods to compare in the String class.
    - Method: equals. leftSide.equals(rightSide) returns true if leftSide and rightSide are identical."
"- Method: compareTo. leftSide.compareTo(rightSide) returns a negative integer value if leftSide is lower than rightSide, 0 if leftSide is equal to rightSide, and a positive integer value if leftSide is higher than rightSide."
"An object as an attribute
Object declaration
The image shows a code snippet in Java that declares an object as an attribute."
"The code is for a class named ""Car"" that has attributes such as ""color"" of type String, ""speed"" of type int, and ""standardEquipment"" of type ""Equipment""."
"The code also includes a comment indicating the syntax for object declaration, which is ""ClassName name;"" for a single object and ""ClassName name1, name2;"" for multiple objects."
"The code then shows an example of object creation using the ""new"" keyword: ""ClassName name = new Equipment();""."
"There is a comment explaining that object declaration is similar to variable declaration, where the type is specified, but in object declaration, the name of the class is used."
"There is also a section on ""Style"" that reminds us that class names (type) should start with a capital letter, while identifiers (objectName) should use lowercase."
"Finally, there is a section on ""Object creation"" that explains that variables are initialized, but objects are created."
"Objects, null reference.
It may happen that a reference to an object has no instance assigned, in this case the special value null is used."
"For example, if we have three student objects, student1, student2 and student3, by default they will be null. Then we assign values to student1 and student2, but student3 is assigned to null."
"The diagram shows that student1 and student2 are pointing to Student objects, but student3 is pointing to a null object."
"Objects Alias
An object can have several references, known as aliases. For example, the code snippet ""Student delegate; delegate = student1;"" shows how a Student object can be referenced by both the ""delegate"" and ""student1"" variables."
"The figure illustrates this concept with a diagram of objects and their references. There are five reference variables: ""student1"", ""delegate"", ""student2"", ""student3"", and ""student5""."
"- ""student1"" and ""delegate"" both reference the same Student object, which contains the value ""Juan"".- ""student5"" references a different Student object, also containing the value ""Juan"".- ""student4"" references a Student object containing the value ""Clara"""
".- ""student2"" and ""student3"" do not reference any object, indicated by the ""null"" value and a black dot."
"This diagram demonstrates that multiple references can point to the same object, and that different objects can hold the same value."
"Arrays, Declaration, Creation, Initialization
 how to initialize an array in programming, which means assigning values to each element.
There are three ways to initialize an array: element by element, using a loop, or direct assignment."
"To initialize an array element by element, you would assign a value to each element individually"
". For example, to initialize the first two elements of an array named ""arrayName"", you would use the following code:""arrayName[0] = element0;"" and ""arrayName[1] = element1;""."
"To initialize an array using a loop, you would use a for loop to iterate through each element of the array and assign it a value. For example, the following code would initialize each element of the array ""arrayName"" to the value of ""element-i"":"
"""for(int i = 0; i < arrayName.length; i++) { arrayName[i] = element-i; }"""
"To initialize an array using direct assignment, you would enclose the values for each element in curly braces and assign them to the array"
". For example, the following code would initialize the array ""arrayName"" with the values ""elem1"", ""elem2"", ""elem3"", and so on:"
"""arrayName = {elem1, elem2, elem3, ...};"""
"Arrays (examples)
Declaration, Creation, Initialization
There are two code snippets, one for arrays with primitive types and one for arrays with objects, that show different ways to declare, create and initialize an array."
"The first snippet shows how to declare, create and initialize an array of integers"
".- The first example shows how to declare an array variable called ""a"" of type integer, then create an array of integers of size 3 and assign it to the variable ""a"", and finally initialize the elements of the array"
".- The second example shows how to declare an array variable called ""a"" of type integer and create an array of integers of size 3 and assign it to the variable ""a"" in the same line, and finally initialize the elements of the array"
".- The third example shows how to declare an array variable called ""a"" of type integer and create an array of integers of size 3 and assign it to the variable ""a"" in the same line, and finally initialize the elements of the array using a for loop"
".- The fourth example shows how to declare, create and initialize an array of integers in the same line."
"The second snippet shows how to declare, create and initialize an array of objects of type MyClass"
".- The first example shows how to declare an array variable called ""a"" of type MyClass, then create an array of MyClass of size 3 and assign it to the variable ""a"", and finally initialize the elements of the array"
".- The second example shows how to declare an array variable called ""a"" of type MyClass and create an array of MyClass of size 3 and assign it to the variable ""a"" in the same line, and finally initialize the elements of the array"
".- The third example shows how to declare an array variable called ""a"" of type MyClass and create an array of MyClass of size 3 and assign it to the variable ""a"" in the same line, and finally initialize the elements of the array using a for loop"
".- The fourth example shows how to declare, create and initialize an array of MyClass in the same line."
"Arrays (common errors): Declaration, Creation, Initialization
 a common error when working with arrays in Java."
"a common error when working with arrays in Java.
We see a code snippet with a common error: an array variable is declared but not initialized, and the code attempts to print the value of its first element."
"The code will not compile, as indicated by the diagram on the right, which shows the code going through a ""compile"" step that leads to ""Compilation failure""."
"Below the code, there is a green rectangle with the message ""variable myArray may not have been initialized""."
"Finally, a red rectangle at the bottom summarizes the error: ""When an array has been declared but not created or initialized, you have no access to its elements. The program does not compile and prints an error message""."
"Arrays (Common errors): Declaration, creation, inicialization"
"We have a code snippet that shows how to declare and create arrays in Java. The code first declares six arrays, one for each of the following data types: int, float, boolean, char, String, and Object. Each array is initialized with a size of 10"
". Each array is initialized with a size of 10. The code then prints the default value for each data type. The default value for an int is 0, for a float is 0.0, for a boolean is false, for a char is a space, for a String is null, and for an Object is null"
". The code then has a note that states that when an array has been declared and created but not initialized, we can retrieve its elements, but they will have their default value."
"N-dimensional Arrays Examples
The image shows examples of how to create N-dimensional arrays in Java."
"The first example shows how to declare and create a 2-dimensional array of Strings in one line. The array is called ""myArray"" and it's initialized with a new String array of size 3x4"
. The image shows a graphical representation of the array with all the values set to null.
"The second example shows how to declare and create a 2-dimensional array of ints step by step. First, the array ""myArray"" is declared. Then, the reference array for rows is created with size ""numRows"""
". Finally, the memory for each row is allocated in a for loop, where each row has size ""numColumns""."
"The last example shows three different ways to create 2-dimensional arrays of ints. The first one, ""a"", is a 3x3 array initialized to 0. The second one, ""b"", is initialized with the values 1, 2, 3 in the first row and 4, 5, 6 in the second row"
". The last one, ""c"", shows how to create a ragged array, where each row can have a different number of columns. In this case, the first row has 5 columns, the second row has 4 columns and the third row has 3 columns"
. The image shows a graphical representation of the three arrays.
"Arrays Homework
Write a program that multiplies two bi-dimensional arrays of integers."
Scenario III: Method implementation
"We have a scenario where after a programmers' meeting, the objective is to demonstrate expertise in method implementation. The first task involves implementing simple methods that function independently without invoking other attributes or methods."
"The objective is to be able to break down a problem to identify the basic steps for solving it, which is essentially algorithm design and representation"
". It also includes using the basic structures of a programming language like variables, operators, and flow control statements such as loops and conditionals to implement an algorithm."
The work plan suggests training in the design of algorithms and their representation. This involves breaking down problems into smaller steps to solve them without writing code
". It emphasizes memorizing the syntax of Java in terms of operators, loops, and conditionals. The focus is on practicing Java to implement previously designed algorithms, aiming for ease and speed in implementation"
". Finally, it recommends resolving typical problems related to arrays, such as printing all elements, retrieving a specific element, swapping elements between two positions, and sorting."
"Step I: Thinking of the algorithm
What tools do we have to represent algorithms?"
"Once we have thought about the algorithm structure, we need to represent the steps to solve it:  We can use Pseudocode, flowcharts and organigrams"
.  Flowcharts and organigrams use figures to represent sentences and flow lines to represent the order in which they are executed.
"Step I: Thinking of the algorithm Flowcharts vs Pseudocode
We can see two different ways of representing an algorithm: a flowchart on the left and pseudocode on the right.
The flowchart describes the steps to fix a lamp:"
"The flowchart describes the steps to fix a lamp:
- It starts with the question ""Lamp doesn't work?"".
- If the answer is yes, then it asks if the ""Lamp plugged in?"".
- If not, then ""Plug in lamp"".
- If yes, then it asks if the ""Bulb burned out?""."
"- If yes, then it asks if the ""Bulb burned out?"".
- If yes, then ""Replace bulb"".
- If not, then ""Repair lamp"".
The pseudocode describes the steps to play the game ""One Potato, Two Potato"":
- It starts with gathering all players in a circle."
"- It starts with gathering all players in a circle.
- Then, players put both fists in the circle.
- A player is chosen to be the counter.
- The counter begins chanting and repeats until one fist is left."
"- The counter repeats 8 times, hitting one fist at a time.
- If the count is 1-3 or 5-7, the counter says the count plus ""potato"".
- If the count is 4, the counter says ""Four!""."
"- If the count is 4, the counter says ""Four!"".
- If the count is 8, the counter says ""More!"", the current fist is taken out, the chant restarts on the next fist, and 1 is added to the count.
- If there is only one fist left, that player is ""it""."
"- If there is only one fist left, that player is ""it"".
- The game ends.
There is also a flowchart at the bottom center of the image. It describes an algorithm to calculate the factorial of a number:
- It starts with reading the input number N."
"- It starts with reading the input number N.
- Then, it initializes two variables: M=1 and F=1.
- It enters a loop that continues as long as M is not equal to N.
- In the loop, it multiplies F by M and stores the result in F.
- Then, it increments M by 1."
"- Then, it increments M by 1.
- Once the loop ends, it prints the value of F, which represents the factorial of N.
- Finally, the algorithm ends."
"Selection sentences (Conditionals)
We have three code snippets that show different conditional statements.
The first one is an ""if"" statement. If the condition is true, the sentences1 will be executed."
"The second one is an ""if-else"" statement. If the condition is true, the sentences1 will be executed. Otherwise, the sentences2 will be executed."
"The third one is a ""switch"" statement. It evaluates an expression and executes the sentences associated with the matching case value. If no case value matches the expression, the default sentences will be executed"
". Each case block should end with a ""break"" statement to prevent the execution from falling through to the next case."
"Iteration sentences (Loops)
We have three code snippets, all of them showing different loop syntax:
- The first one is a **for loop**:
```
for( initialization;condition;update) {
sentences;
}
```
- The second one is a **while loop**:
```"
"sentences;
}
```
- The second one is a **while loop**:
```
while( condition) {
sentences;
}
```
- The third one is a **do-while loop**:
```
do {
sentences;
}while(condition);
```"
"Iteration sentences (Examples: for)
There are 5 code snippets, each showing a for loop in C.
- The first snippet initializes an integer ""i"" to 0. The loop iterates as long as ""i"" is less than 10. In each iteration, ""i"" is incremented by 2."
"- The second snippet initializes an integer ""i"" to 0. The loop iterates as long as ""i"" is less than 10, incrementing ""i"" by 1 in each iteration. However, the initial value of ""i"" is 13, which is already greater than 10"
". Therefore, the loop will not execute."
"- The third snippet initializes an integer ""i"" to 4. The loop iterates as long as ""i"" is less than 10. In each iteration, ""i"" is incremented by 2."
"- The fourth snippet initializes an integer ""i"" to 0. The loop iterates indefinitely because there is no condition specified in the for loop. In each iteration, ""i"" is incremented by 2."
"- The fifth snippet initializes two integers, ""i"" to 0 and ""sum"" to 5. The loop iterates as long as ""i"" is less than 10. In each iteration, ""sum"" is incremented by the value of ""i"", and then ""i"" is incremented by 8."
"The question asks how many times each loop is executed and the value of ""i"" at the end of each loop."
Iteration sentences (Examples: for)
"The most often used iteration is the 'for' loop. The syntax is the following: 'for' open parenthesis, 'int' 'i' equals '0' semicolon, 'i' less than '5' semicolon, 'i' plus plus, close parenthesis. Then, between curly brackets, '//'sentences."
"Breaking up the flow of execution: Break sentence
 the break statement in programming.
- The break statement causes the execution to break and exit the structure in a while, for, do-while or switch statement."
"There is a code example that shows how the break statement works:
```java
int j=0;
while(j<10){
  j++;
  break;
  System.out.println(""This message is never printed"");
}
System.out.println(“j = ""+j);
```"
"}
System.out.println(“j = ""+j);
```
The loop runs only once and prints the message ""j = 1"" because the break statement is executed after the first iteration, which exits the loop."
"Breaking up the flow of execution: Continue sentence
 how to use the continue sentence in Java.
- The continue sentence can be used in while, for or do-while blocks of code."
"- When it is executed, it skips the rest of the sentences in the block and continues with the next iteration.
 a code example to illustrate this:
```java
int j=0
while(j<10){
  j++;
  continue;
  System.out.println(""This message is never printed"");
}
```"
"System.out.println(""This message is never printed"");
}
```
In this example, the message ""This message is never printed"" will never be printed because the continue sentence will always be executed before it.
 by stating that the message is never printed."
"Implementing a method: Step 1.1: Think about the algorithm
We are looking at the first step in implementing a method to determine if a number is prime. The first step is to think about the algorithm."
The problem is to write a program that calculates whether a number n is prime.
The first step in thinking about the algorithm is to split the problem into simpler steps. We start by checking if each number from 2 to n/2 is an integer divisor of n
". We only need to repeat this process until we find an integer divisor or until we reach n/2. To control the loop, we will use a sentinel, which is a Boolean variable."
Implementing a method: Step 1.2: Represent the algorithm
"The image shows a flowchart.- The first step is a rectangular box that sets the value of a variable named ""divisor"" to 2 and the value of a variable named ""isPrime"" to true"
".- Then, there is a diamond-shaped box that checks if the value of ""divisor"" is less than half the value of ""n"" and if ""isPrime"" is true"
".- If both conditions are true, the flow continues to another diamond-shaped box that checks if the remainder of the division of ""n"" by ""divisor"" is equal to 0.- If the remainder is 0, the flow continues to a rectangular box that sets ""isPrime"" to false"
".- If the remainder is not 0 or if either of the conditions in the first diamond-shaped box is false, the flow continues to a rectangular box that increments the value of ""divisor"" by 1"
".- Finally, the flow goes back to the first diamond-shaped box to repeat the process."
"Implementing a method:
Step 2: Write the code
 a code snippet of a method written in Java that determines if a given number is a prime number."
"The method is called ""Is A Prime Number"" and takes an integer called ""number"" as input. It initializes an integer variable called ""divisor"" to 2 and a boolean variable called ""isPrime"" to true."
"The code then enters a while loop that continues as long as the divisor is less than half of the number and isPrime is true. Inside the loop, it checks if the number is divisible by the divisor"
". If it is, it sets isPrime to false and increments the divisor."
"After the loop, the code prints the number to the console and then checks the value of isPrime. If it's true, it prints ""is prime"", otherwise it prints ""is not prime"". Finally, the method returns the value of isPrime."
"Implementing a method:
Examples: working with arrays"
several practice exercises related to implementing methods for working with arrays
". The exercises include: printing an array using loops, retrieving a specific element from an array using conditionals and nested loops, comparing elements in an array using different data types (numbers, characters, booleans, strings, and objects)"
", characters, booleans, strings, and objects), swapping two elements in an array using auxiliary variables, and sorting an array by copying elements between two arrays"

". The class also has a constructor that takes the color, speed, and size as input and initializes the corresponding attributes"
". Additionally, the class has four public methods: ""advance"", ""stop"", ""turnLeft"", and ""turnRight"", all of which take no arguments and return void."
"On the right-hand side, we see three instances of the ""Car"" class, represented by images of cars in different colors: green, red, and yellow"
". These instances are created in the ""main"" method, which is a special method in Java that is executed when the program starts. The ""main"" method creates three ""Car"" objects: ""myCar"" with color ""green"", speed 80, and size 3"

"Naming
If we define the Car class from the Vehicle class, it is said that: Car *inherits* attributes and methods from Vehicle. Car *extends* Vehicle. Car is a *subclass* of Vehicle. Vehicle is a *superclass* of Car."
"There is a list of terms: Derived class, Child class, Base class, Parent class.

Declaration of subclasses

There is a diagram showing the inheritance hierarchy of some classes.
There is a base class ""Person"" from which two classes inherit: ""Student"" and ""Employee""."
"""Employee"" has two subclasses: ""Professor"" and ""Secretary"".
There is also a code snippet showing how to declare the classes:
""class"" Person { ... }
""class"" Student ""extends"" Person { ... }
""class"" Employee ""extends"" Person { ... }"
"""class"" Employee ""extends"" Person { ... }
""class"" Professor ""extends"" Employee { ... }
""class"" Secretary ""extends"" Employee { ... }
Finally, there is a note indicating that each class is in a different file and declared as public.
Subclass"
"We see a class diagram representing the concept of inheritance. The subclass ""Student"" inherits from the superclass ""Person"". The ""Person"" class has attributes: ""firstName"", ""lastName"", and ""birthYear"", and a method ""print"""
". The ""Student"" class inherits these attributes and method, and additionally has attributes: ""group"" and ""timetable"", and methods: ""setGroup"", ""setTimetable"", and ""printGroup""."
How is it used?
"We see the code for a class named Person. The class has three protected attributes: firstName, lastName and birthYear. It also has three methods: an empty constructor, a constructor with parameters to initialize the attributes and a print method"
". The print method outputs the text ""Personal data:"" followed by the value of the firstName attribute, then a space, then the lastName attribute, then a space, then an opening parenthesis, then the birthYear attribute and finally a closing parenthesis."
"On the right-hand side, there is a diagram representing a class that inherits from the Person class. The subclass inherits the three attributes: firstName, lastName and birthYear, and the print method.
What if...?"
"What if...?
We are defining the attribute ""firstName"" of ""Person"" as private. We inherit it, but we cannot access it unless we implement methods to do so, for example: ""getFirstName""."
"We implement the constructor of the subclass ""Student"", assigning the values directly to attributes instead of calling to ""super"". This means we are not taking advantage of code reuse"
". This means we are not taking advantage of code reuse. It is valid in this case because attributes are defined as protected, but this is not always the case."
"There are two code snippets, one on the left and one on the right, both showing the constructor of the subclass ""Student""."
"The code on the left shows the constructor ""Student"" with parameters ""firstName"", ""lastName"", ""birthYear"", ""group"" and ""timetable"". It then assigns each parameter to the corresponding attribute of the class."
"The code on the right shows the constructor ""Student"" with the same parameters as before. However, in this case, it calls the constructor of the superclass, ""super"", with parameters ""firstName"", ""lastName"" and ""birthYear"""
". Then, it assigns the parameters ""group"" and ""timetable"" to the corresponding attributes of the class."
"Finally, there is a big ""OK"" at the bottom right of the image.
Consequences of extension of classes
There are two bullet points on this slide, both discussing the consequences of class extension:  of the interface and  of the implementation."
"The first bullet point,  of the interface, states that the public part of the subclass contains the public part of the superclass. For example, the Student class contains the method print()."

".print(), the expected behavior takes place."
"hierarchy in Java
In Java, all classes are related through a single inheritance hierarchy.
A class can:
- Explicitly inherit from another class, or
- Implicitly inherit from the **Object** class (defined in the Java core)"
"This is the case both for predefined classes and for user-defined classes.

There is a diagram showing the inheritance hierarchy of some classes.
There is a base class ""Person"" from which two classes inherit: ""Student"" and ""Employee""."
"""Employee"" has two subclasses: ""Professor"" and ""Secretary"".
There is also a code snippet showing how to declare the classes:

""class"" Employee ""extends"" Person { ... }"
"""class"" Employee ""extends"" Person { ... }
""class"" Professor ""extends"" Employee { ... }
""class"" Secretary ""extends"" Employee { ... }
Finally, there is a note indicating that each class is in a different file and declared as public.
Subclass"
"We see a class diagram representing the concept of inheritance. The subclass ""Student"" inherits from the superclass ""Person"". The ""Person"" class has attributes: ""firstName"", ""lastName"", and ""birthYear"", and a method ""print"""
". The ""Student"" class inherits these attributes and method, and additionally has attributes: ""group"" and ""timetable"", and methods: ""setGroup"", ""setTimetable"", and ""printGroup""."
How is it used?
"We see the code for a class named Person. The class has three protected attributes: firstName, lastName and birthYear. It also has three methods: an empty constructor, a constructor with parameters to initialize the attributes and a print method"
". The print method outputs the text ""Personal data:"" followed by the value of the firstName attribute, then a space, then the lastName attribute, then a space, then an opening parenthesis, then the birthYear attribute and finally a closing parenthesis."
"On the right-hand side, there is a diagram representing a class that inherits from the Person class. The subclass inherits the three attributes: firstName, lastName and birthYear, and the print method.
What if...?"
"What if...?
We are defining the attribute ""firstName"" of ""Person"" as private. We inherit it, but we cannot access it unless we implement methods to do so, for example: ""getFirstName""."
"We implement the constructor of the subclass ""Student"", assigning the values directly to attributes instead of calling to ""super"". This means we are not taking advantage of code reuse"

"The code on the right shows the constructor ""Student"" with the same parameters as before. However, in this case, it calls the constructor of the superclass, ""super"", with parameters ""firstName"", ""lastName"" and ""birthYear"""

"Finally, there is a big ""OK"" at the bottom right of the image.
Consequences of extension of classes
There are two bullet points on this slide, both discussing the consequences of class extension:  of the interface and  of the implementation."
"The first bullet point,  of the interface, states that the public part of the subclass contains the public part of the superclass. For example, the Student class contains the method print()."
"The second bullet point,  of the implementation, states that the implementation of the subclass contains the implementation of the superclass. When calling the method of the superclass on an object of the subclass, for example aStudent"
".print(), the expected behavior takes place."
"hierarchy in Java
In Java, all classes are related through a single inheritance hierarchy.
A class can:
- Explicitly inherit from another class, or
- Implicitly inherit from the **Object** class (defined in the Java core)"
"This is the case both for predefined classes and for user-defined classes.

What if...?"
"What if...?
We are defining the attribute ""firstName"" of ""Person"" as private. We inherit it, but we cannot access it unless we implement methods to do so, for example: ""getFirstName""."
"We implement the constructor of the subclass ""Student"", assigning the values directly to attributes instead of calling to ""super"". This means we are not taking advantage of code reuse"
". This means we are not taking advantage of code reuse. It is valid in this case because attributes are defined as protected, but this is not always the case."
"There are two code snippets, one on the left and one on the right, both showing the constructor of the subclass ""Student""."
"The code on the left shows the constructor ""Student"" with parameters ""firstName"", ""lastName"", ""birthYear"", ""group"" and ""timetable"". It then assigns each parameter to the corresponding attribute of the class."
"The code on the right shows the constructor ""Student"" with the same parameters as before. However, in this case, it calls the constructor of the superclass, ""super"", with parameters ""firstName"", ""lastName"" and ""birthYear"""
". Then, it assigns the parameters ""group"" and ""timetable"" to the corresponding attributes of the class."
"Finally, there is a big ""OK"" at the bottom right of the image.
Consequences of extension of classes
There are two bullet points on this slide, both discussing the consequences of class extension:  of the interface and  of the implementation."
"The first bullet point,  of the interface, states that the public part of the subclass contains the public part of the superclass. For example, the Student class contains the method print()."
"The second bullet point,  of the implementation, states that the implementation of the subclass contains the implementation of the superclass. When calling the method of the superclass on an object of the subclass, for example aStudent"
".print(), the expected behavior takes place."
"hierarchy in Java
In Java, all classes are related through a single inheritance hierarchy.
A class can:
- Explicitly inherit from another class, or
- Implicitly inherit from the **Object** class (defined in the Java core)"
"This is the case both for predefined classes and for user-defined classes.
 hierarchy in Java"
"We see a diagram depicting the inheritance hierarchy in Java. At the top is the Object class. Below that are Boolean, Character, Number, String, and Person. Below Number are Integer, Long, Float, and Double. Below Person are Student and Employee"
". Below Person are Student and Employee. Below Employee are Secretary and Professor. There are three dots to the right of Person, indicating that there are more classes that inherit from Object."
"Below the diagram, we see two lines of code. The first line, ""Integer i = new Integer(3);"", is marked as deprecated with a warning. The second line, ""Integer i = 3;"", is an example of autoboxing.
Overriding"
"Overriding
- Modification of the elements of the base class inside the derived class
- The derived class can define:
  - An attribute with the same name as one of the base class, which is called attribute hiding"
"- A method with the same signature as one of the base class, which is called method overriding
- The second case, method overriding, is more usual"

- 'super' is useful when overriding methods"
We see an example of a 'Student' class extending a 'Person' class. The 'print' method in the 'Student' class calls the 'print' method of the 'Person' class using 'super.print()' and then prints additional information.
"PolymorphismWhat is it?
• Capacity of an object for deciding which method to apply,
depending on the class it belongs to
– A call to a method on a reference of a generic type (e.g., base"
"class) executes different implementations of the methoddepending on which class the object was created as
• Allows designing and implementing extensible systems
– Programs can process generic objects"
"(described by references of the superclass)
– The specific behavior depends on the subclasses
– New subclasses can be added later"
"PolymorphismExample
• Student, Professor and Secretary
• We create an array of Person where we include objects of
Student, Professor and Secretary."
"Student, Professor and Secretary.
• When calling the method print(), overridden in classesStudent, Professor and Secretary, on the array ofPerson, each object uses its own implementation of themethod

new Secretary(…), new Student(…)};
for (int i=0; i<group.length; i++){
group[i].print();
}"
"PolymorphismDynamic binding
• The power of method overriding is that the correct
method is properly called, even though the object ofthe child class is referenced through the base class
• This mechanism is called “dynamic binding”"
"• This mechanism is called “dynamic binding”
– Allows detecting the proper method to call during

". It takes a string array as an argument. Inside the method, we see how to access the static attribute numberOfWheels using the class name Car followed by a dot and the attribute name."
"On the right-hand side, we see other examples of static members. We have the mathematical constant PI, the minimum value of an integer, and the maximum value of an integer."
"The last code snippet shows that the static method main can access other static members without creating instances of the class. In this case, we are using the static methods sqrt and cos from the Math class.

"When applied to **parameters**, it means that their value cannot be changed inside the method. For example, in the code snippet 'public void myMethod(final int[] p1, int p2) { }', the values of p1 cannot be changed."
"When applied to **attributes**, it means that their value cannot be changed in the class. It is used together with 'static' to define constants. For example, in the code snippet 'public static final double PI = 3.14;', the value of PI cannot be changed."
"When applied to **methods**, it means that they cannot be overridden in derived classes. For example, in the code snippet 'public final void myMethod() { }', myMethod cannot be overridden."
"When applied to **classes**, it means that the class cannot be extended or inherited. For example, in the code snippet 'public final class myClass(){}', myClass cannot be extended."

"Casting (Type conversion)
Syntax and terminology
• Syntax:(type) identifier
• Two types of casting:
– Widening or upcasting: a subclass is used as aninstance of the superclass. Implicit conversion"
"– Narrowing or downcasting: The superclass isused as an instance of a subclass. Explicitconversion.
• Casting can only be applied to parent and
child classes, not to sibling classes
– String s = “3”;
– Integer i = (Integer) s;"
"– String s = “3”;
– Integer i = (Integer) s;
– Integer i = Integer.parseInt(s);"
"Syntax and terminology
Let's talk about casting in programming, specifically type conversion, its syntax, and terminology."
"Casting syntax follows this structure: within parentheses, you specify the desired data type, followed by the identifier representing the variable or value you want to cast.
There are two primary types of casting:"
"There are two primary types of casting:
- Widening or upcasting: This involves using a subclass as an instance of its superclass. This type of conversion is implicit, meaning the compiler handles it automatically."
"- Narrowing or downcasting: In this case, the superclass is treated as an instance of its subclass. This conversion is explicit, requiring you to explicitly instruct the compiler to perform the cast."
"It's important to note that casting is applicable only between parent and child classes within the class hierarchy. Sibling classes cannot be cast to each other.
To illustrate, let's look at some examples:"
"To illustrate, let's look at some examples:
- The first example shows a string ""3"" assigned to a variable 's'.
- The second example demonstrates an incorrect attempt to directly assign this string to an Integer variable 'i'."
"- The third example provides the correct way to achieve this conversion using Integer.parseInt(s), which correctly parses the string ""3"" into its integer equivalent.
Widening or upcasting"
"Widening or upcasting
Here we are discussing the concept of casting, specifically widening or upcasting."
"The first type of casting, upcasting, refers to compatibility upwards, towards the base class. An object of the derived class can always be used as an object of the base class because it implements an “is-a” relationship"
". For example, the code snippet ""Person p = new Student();"" shows how a variable of type Person can be assigned a new Student object."
"Narrowing or downcasting
Downcasting: compatibility downwards (towards the derived classes)
- Downcasting cannot be applied by default, because an object of the base class is not always an object of the derived class"
"Here we have an example of wrong syntax: ""Student s = new Person(); // wrong""
- It is only possible when the reference of the base class points to an object of the derived class
- In these cases, an explicit casting must be applied
Example"
"Example
The image shows an example of casting in Java. Casting is a type conversion that allows you to treat an object of one type as an object of another type. The example shows how to cast a Student object to a Person object and vice versa."
"The first example shows implicit upcasting, which is allowed because a Student is always a Person. The second example shows implicit downcasting, which is not allowed because a Person is not always a Student"
". The third example shows explicit downcasting, which is allowed because the programmer is explicitly stating that the Person object is actually a Student object."
"The image also includes a note that explains that if someone is both a person and a student, they can be required to do things that are specific to students, but only if it is explicitly stated that they will be treated as a student.

. The comment highlights that this approach doesn't work due to a compiler error.
"The second code snippet explores explicit downcasting using type casting. While this approach might seem plausible, it can lead to a ClassCastException at runtime"
. The comment explains that this exception occurs because the Person object (p2) might not actually represent a Student object.

"instanceof operator
- Syntax: object instanceof class
- Checks if an object is really an instance of a given class
Example:"
"In this example, we have a code snippet that defines a public method called ""check"" that takes a ""Person"" object as input and returns a ""Student"" object. Inside the method, a ""Student"" object ""s"" is initialized to null"
". Then, an ""if"" statement checks if the input ""Person"" object ""p"" is an instance of the ""Student"" class using the ""instanceof"" operator. If it is, the ""Student"" object ""s"" is assigned the value of ""p"" casted to the ""Student"" type"

"instanceof operator
- Syntax: object instanceof class
- Checks if an object is really an instance of a given class
Example:"
"In this example, we have a code snippet that defines a public method called ""check"" that takes a ""Person"" object as input and returns a ""Student"" object. Inside the method, a ""Student"" object ""s"" is initialized to null"
". Then, an ""if"" statement checks if the input ""Person"" object ""p"" is an instance of the ""Student"" class using the ""instanceof"" operator. If it is, the ""Student"" object ""s"" is assigned the value of ""p"" casted to the ""Student"" type"
". Finally, the ""Student"" object ""s"" is returned.```java"
"public Student check(Person p) {
  Student s = null;
  if (p instanceof Student)
    s = (Student) p;
  return s;
}
```"
"Casting (Type conversion)
instanceof operator
• Syntax:
object instanceof class
– Checks if an object is really an instance of a
given class
• Example:
public Student check(Person p) {
Student s = null;
if (p instanceof Student)
s = (Student) p;
return s;"
"if (p instanceof Student)
s = (Student) p;
return s;
}"
"Syntax and terminology
Let's talk about casting in programming, specifically type conversion, its syntax, and terminology."
"Casting syntax follows this structure: within parentheses, you specify the desired data type, followed by the identifier representing the variable or value you want to cast.
There are two primary types of casting:"
"There are two primary types of casting:
- Widening or upcasting: This involves using a subclass as an instance of its superclass. This type of conversion is implicit, meaning the compiler handles it automatically."
"- Narrowing or downcasting: In this case, the superclass is treated as an instance of its subclass. This conversion is explicit, requiring you to explicitly instruct the compiler to perform the cast."
"It's important to note that casting is applicable only between parent and child classes within the class hierarchy. Sibling classes cannot be cast to each other.
To illustrate, let's look at some examples:"
"To illustrate, let's look at some examples:
- The first example shows a string ""3"" assigned to a variable 's'.
- The second example demonstrates an incorrect attempt to directly assign this string to an Integer variable 'i'."
"- The third example provides the correct way to achieve this conversion using Integer.parseInt(s), which correctly parses the string ""3"" into its integer equivalent.
Widening or upcasting"
"Widening or upcasting
Here we are discussing the concept of casting, specifically widening or upcasting."
"The first type of casting, upcasting, refers to compatibility upwards, towards the base class. An object of the derived class can always be used as an object of the base class because it implements an “is-a” relationship"
". For example, the code snippet ""Person p = new Student();"" shows how a variable of type Person can be assigned a new Student object."
"Narrowing or downcasting
Downcasting: compatibility downwards (towards the derived classes)
- Downcasting cannot be applied by default, because an object of the base class is not always an object of the derived class"
"Here we have an example of wrong syntax: ""Student s = new Person(); // wrong""
- It is only possible when the reference of the base class points to an object of the derived class
- In these cases, an explicit casting must be applied
Example"
"Example
The image shows an example of casting in Java. Casting is a type conversion that allows you to treat an object of one type as an object of another type. The example shows how to cast a Student object to a Person object and vice versa."
"The first example shows implicit upcasting, which is allowed because a Student is always a Person. The second example shows implicit downcasting, which is not allowed because a Person is not always a Student"
". The third example shows explicit downcasting, which is allowed because the programmer is explicitly stating that the Person object is actually a Student object."
"The image also includes a note that explains that if someone is both a person and a student, they can be required to do things that are specific to students, but only if it is explicitly stated that they will be treated as a student.

"What is an interface?
-  take the abstract class concept one step further
- All methods in the interface are abstract
-  are always public
    - Interface attributes are public by default
    - Interface methods are public by default"
"- Interface methods are public by default
-  are implemented by classes
    - A class implements an interface defining the body of all the methods
    - An abstract class implements an interface implementing or declaring abstracts the methods"
"- A class (abstract or not) can implement one or more interfaces
What is an interface?
- An *interface* is a pure design element: what to do.
- A *class* (including abstract ones) is a mix of design and implementation: what to do and how."
"- Different classes can implement the same interface in different ways.
Declaration
Let's talk about the syntax for declaring interfaces."
"Let's talk about the syntax for declaring interfaces.
We start with the keywords ""public interface"" followed by the name of the interface. The body of the interface is enclosed in curly braces.
Inside the interface, we can define constants and methods."
"Inside the interface, we can define constants and methods.
Constants are declared using the keywords ""static final"" followed by the type, the constant name, the assignment operator, and the value. Constant declarations end with a semicolon."
"Methods are declared with the return type, the method name, and the parameters in parentheses. Note that method declarations in interfaces do not include braces or a method body. Instead, they end with a semicolon."
There are two important notes to keep in mind.
"First, as mentioned earlier, method declarations in interfaces do not include braces. This is because the method is not implemented in the interface itself. The implementation is provided by the classes that implement the interface."
"Second, constants and methods in interfaces are always public, even if the ""public"" keyword is not explicitly used. This is because interfaces are meant to be accessed by other classes.
Implementation"
"Implementation
- If a class implements an interface, it implements all abstract methods declared in such interface
- Represented with the reserved word 'implements'
There is a code snippet:
public class MyClass implements Interface, Interface2 {...}"
"public class MyClass implements Interface, Interface2 {...}
The snippet shows how to implement interfaces in a class declaration.
What are they for?. Multiple inheritance"
"What are they for?. Multiple inheritance

Scenario IV: Declare and implement a class
"the fourth scenario of a programming course, which focuses on declaring and implementing a class. The scenario assumes prior knowledge of reading code and implementing methods"
. The objective is to design a new class that defines a new data type with its own characteristics and behavior.
"There are two main learning objectives: first, to be able to declare a class with attributes (characteristics) and methods (behavior), and second, to be able to create objects from this class and manage access to their state and behavior."
"The work plan for achieving these objectives includes: memorizing the basic nomenclature of object-oriented programming, practicing object modeling with simple examples to understand the distinction between a class, an object, its state, and its behavior"
", an object, its state, and its behavior, reviewing the Java syntax for declaring classes, attributes, constructors, and methods, and finally, reviewing the mechanism and syntax for message passing between objects"
.
"Some classes so far...
We have two classes, car and bicycle. Both classes have attributes and methods."
Scenario V: Reusing code. Inheritance
"the concept of inheritance in programming. It starts by stating that once you can create your own classes, you are ready to work in teams and reuse code developed by your colleagues"
. Your team will provide you with a set of classes and you are required to create specializations or generalizations of them.
The objective of this scenario is to be able to create a derived class adding some characteristics (attributes) and behavior (methods) to an existing class
. You should also be able to extract all the common code from a set of similar classes in order to group it into a new parent class so that the code is easier to maintain
". Finally, you should be able to create objects, and reference and access their attributes and methods, depending on their position in the inheritance hierarchy and their modifiers."
"The work plan for this scenario is to memorize the naming related to inheritance, memorize the Java syntax related to inheritance (`extends`), to reference (`super`, `this`) and to advanced access modifiers (`protected`)"
". You should also know basic inheritance mechanisms, such as attribute hiding, overriding of methods, and what they are used for and how they are used."
"Inheritance What is it?
We see two class diagrams, one with no inheritance and one with inheritance."
"On the left diagram titled ""No inheritance"", we have two classes, ""Classroom"" and ""Computer"", which both have the attributes ""name"", ""description"", ""getName()"", ""getDescription()"""
". Additionally, ""Classroom"" has the attribute ""location"" and the method ""getLocation()"", and ""Computer"" has the attribute ""operatingSystem"" and the method ""getOS()""."
"On the right diagram titled ""Inheritance"", we have a parent class ""Resource"" with the attributes ""name"", ""description"", ""getName()"", ""getDescription()"". The child classes ""Classroom"" and ""Computer"" inherit from ""Resource"""
". ""Classroom"" also has the attribute ""location"" and the method ""getLocation()"", and ""Computer"" has the attribute ""operatingSystem"" and the method ""getOS()""."
The text explains that the attributes and methods that appear in blue in the parent class are repeated in the subclasses in the left diagram
". It is not necessary to repeat the code, you only have to say that a class extends the other or inherits from it, as shown in the right diagram."
Inheritance How is it used?
"We see a code snippet defining a class named ""Student"" that inherits from a class named ""Person"". The ""Student"" class has two protected attributes: ""group"" of type String and ""timetable"" of type char"
". It also has three methods: ""setGroup"", ""setTimetable"", and ""printGroup"". The ""setGroup"" method checks if the group is null or empty and prints an error message if it is. Otherwise, it sets the group attribute to the given value"
". Otherwise, it sets the group attribute to the given value. The ""setTimetable"" method checks if the timetable is 'M' or 'A' and prints an error message if it is not. Otherwise, it sets the timetable attribute to the given value"
". Otherwise, it sets the timetable attribute to the given value. The ""printGroup"" method prints the group and timetable attributes"
". The ""Student"" class also has a constructor that takes the student's first name, last name, birth year, group, and timetable as arguments"
". This constructor calls the superclass constructor to initialize the first name, last name, and birth year attributes, and then it calls the ""setGroup"" and ""setTimetable"" methods to initialize the group and timetable attributes."
"On the right-hand side, we have a diagram representing the ""Student"" class. It shows that the ""Student"" class inherits from the ""Person"" class and lists the attributes and methods of both classes"
". The ""Student"" class has two attributes: ""group"" and ""timetable"". It also has three methods: ""setGroup"", ""setTimetable"", and ""printGroup"". The ""Person"" class has three attributes: ""firstName"", ""lastName"", and ""birthYear"". It also has one method: ""print"""
". It also has one method: ""print"". The diagram also shows that the ""Student"" class inherits the ""print"" method from the ""Person"" class."
"Finally, the keyword ""super"" is used to access attributes or methods from the superclass."
Inheritance How is it used?
"We see a code snippet of a program written in Java. The program defines a class named ""Test"" with a main method. Inside the main method, two objects are created: ""neighbor"" of type ""Person"" and ""aStudent"" of type ""Student"""
". The ""Student"" class inherits from the ""Person"" class. Both objects are initialized with data, and then several methods are called on them, including ""setGroup"", ""setTimetable"", ""print"", and ""printGroup""."
"The expected output of the program is shown below the code, indicating that it will print personal data for both the ""Person"" and ""Student"" objects, including the student's group"
". This example demonstrates the concept of inheritance in object-oriented programming, where a subclass (Student) can inherit properties and methods from a superclass (Person)."
"Polymorphism
What is it?
Polymorphism is the capacity of an object for deciding which method to apply, depending on the class it belongs to."
"A call to a method on a reference of a generic type, for example, a base class, executes different implementations of the method depending on which class the object was created as.
Polymorphism allows designing and implementing extensible systems."
"Programs can process generic objects described by references of the superclass.
The specific behavior depends on the subclasses.
New subclasses can be added later."
"Polymorphism
Example"
"We have an example of polymorphism with Student, Professor and Secretary. We create an array of Person where we include objects of Student, Professor and Secretary"
". When calling the method print(), overridden in classes Student, Professor and Secretary, on the array of Person, each object uses its own implementation of the method."
The code snippet shows how to create an array of Person objects and how to call the print() method on each object in the array.- The first line of code declares an array of Person objects called group
".- The second line of code initializes the array with four Person objects: a Student, a Professor, a Secretary, and another Student.- The third line of code is a for loop that iterates over the array of Person objects"
.- The fourth line of code calls the print() method on each Person object in the array.
"Polymorphism
Dynamic binding"
"The power of method overriding is that the correct method is properly called even though the object of the child class is referenced through the base class. This mechanism is called ""dynamic binding"""
". This mechanism is called ""dynamic binding"". It allows detecting the proper method to call during runtime. The compiler does not generate the calling code during compile time, it only generates code for calculating which method to call"
". This is different from ""static binding"" (e.g., method overloading) where the proper method is detected at compile time."
"**Contents**
- Casting and type compatibility
- Abstract classes and methods
- Interfaces"
"Abstract classes Polymorphism
The image shows a code snippet illustrating the concept of polymorphism in object-oriented programming using abstract classes."
"An array named ""myFigures"" of type ""Figure"" is declared and initialized with a size of 3. The ""Figure"" class is abstract, meaning it cannot be instantiated directly."
"Each element of the array is then assigned an instance of a concrete subclass of ""Figure"": ""Rectangle"", ""Triangle"", and ""Square"". This demonstrates polymorphism, as the array can hold objects of different but related types."
"The code then iterates through the ""myFigures"" array and calls the ""area()"" method on each element. Since ""area()"" is declared in the abstract ""Figure"" class, each concrete subclass must provide its own implementation"
". This ensures that the correct area calculation is performed based on the actual type of object at runtime, showcasing dynamic binding."
"An annotation highlights that calling the ""area()"" method on objects of type ""Figure"" during runtime will determine the specific object type and execute the appropriate method. This dynamic behavior is referred to as ""Dynamic binding""."
"Another annotation points out that although the array ""myFigures"" is of type ""Figure"" (abstract), its elements are instances of concrete classes, namely ""Rectangle"", ""Triangle"", and ""Square"", which are non-abstract subclasses of ""Figure""."
"Interfaces. Interface inheritance. Polymorphism
- Interfaces can also have an inheritance hierarchy.
- Classes implementing the interfaces in the hierarchy must include all the methods defined in the interfaces."
- Interfaces also support dynamic resolution of methods during runtime (dynamic binding).
"The table describes Java modifiers.
The table lists 6 access modifiers: public, friendly (package), protected, private, abstract and final, and one modifier that changes the behavior of members of a class: static."
"For each modifier, the table describes how it affects classes, methods and attributes.
**public** elements are accessible from any other class.
**(friendly)** elements are only accessible to classes in the same package."
"**protected** elements are accessible to the class, its subclasses and classes in the same package.
**private** elements are only accessible inside the class."
"**private** elements are only accessible inside the class.
**abstract** classes cannot be instantiated but are designed to be inherited from. They have no code, and it is implemented in the subclasses. They must have at least one abstract method."
**final** classes cannot be extended and are a leaf in the inheritance tree. Final methods cannot be overridden. Final attributes are constants and their value cannot be changed.
"**static** elements are the same for all the class objects. To use a static method, use ClassName.method(); To use a static attribute, use ClassName.attribute;"

. The formula is fib(n) equals open parenthesis one plus the square root of five close parenthesis to the power of n plus 1 minus open parenthesis 1 minus the square root of 5 close parenthesis to the power of n plus 1 all divided by open parenthesis 2 to
to the power of n plus 1 all divided by open parenthesis 2 to the power of n plus 1 times the square root of 5 close parenthesis
.
"**Recursion vs. Iteration**
*Computing the factorial*
The factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example, 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120."
two ways to compute the factorial of a number: recursively and iteratively.
"The recursive approach defines a function `fac(n, m)` that takes two integer arguments, n and m. If n is less than or equal to 1, the function returns m. Otherwise, it returns the result of calling `fac()` with n-1 and n*m as arguments."
"The iterative approach defines a function `fac(n, m)` that takes two integer arguments, n and m. The function uses a while loop to iterate over the numbers from n down to 2, multiplying m by each number in turn"
". When the loop finishes, the function returns m."
"Both approaches achieve the same result, but they do so in different ways. The recursive approach is more concise and elegant, but it can be less efficient than the iterative approach for large values of n"
". This is because each recursive call adds a new frame to the call stack, which can lead to a stack overflow error if the recursion is too deep"
". The iterative approach, on the other hand, does not use recursion, so it is not susceptible to stack overflow errors."

"**Double queue class (DLDeque) with doubly-linked lists: Extraction from the beginning**
The image shows the code and a diagram illustrating the process of removing the first element from a double-ended queue implemented using a doubly-linked list."
The code is a Java method called `removeFirst()` that returns an element of generic type `E`.
. **Initialization:** The method starts by initializing a variable `info` of type `E` to `null`. This variable will store the information of the element being removed.
". **Checking for an empty queue:** It then checks if the queue is empty by comparing the `next` pointer of the `head` node to the `tail` node. If they are the same, the queue is empty, and the method returns the initial `null` value of `info`."
". **Extracting the first element:** If the queue is not empty, the method retrieves the first node after the `head` and stores it in the `first` variable. The information of this node is then extracted and stored in the `info` variable."
". **Updating pointers:** Next, the method gets the second node in the queue and stores it in the `second` variable. The `next` pointer of the `head` node is updated to point to the `second` node, effectively removing the `first` node from the queue"
". The `prev` pointer of the `second` node is then updated to point to the `head` node, maintaining the doubly-linked list structure."
. **Decreasing the size:** The size of the queue is decremented by one to reflect the removal of an element.
". **Returning the removed element:** Finally, the method returns the `info` variable, which contains the information of the element that was removed from the beginning of the queue."
"The diagram visually represents the doubly-linked list before and after the removal of the first element. The orange boxes represent the nodes of the list, with arrows indicating the `next` and `prev` pointers"
". The first node, labeled ""first"", is removed from the list, and the `head` pointer is updated to point to the second node. The `Moscú` element is removed from the queue."
**Insertion (without dummy nodes)**
"The image shows three existing nodes in a doubly linked list, labeled ""head"", ""prev"", and ""tail"". Each node has two pointers: one to the previous node (""prev"") and one to the next node"
". The ""head"" node's ""prev"" pointer points to ""null"", indicating that it is the first node in the list. Similarly, the ""tail"" node's next pointer points to ""null"", indicating it is the last node."
"A new node, colored red, is being inserted into the list. The code snippet below the diagram shows the creation of this new node:
```
DLNode<E> node = new DLNode<E>(data);
```"
"```
DLNode<E> node = new DLNode<E>(data);
```
This line of code creates a new `DLNode` object with the given data and assigns it to the variable `node`. The `<E>` syntax indicates that this is a generic type, meaning it can hold any type of data."

". The elements are ordered by priority, with E having the highest priority and Q having the lowest. When a new element is inserted into the queue, it is compared to the existing elements and placed in the appropriate position based on its priority."
"The second implementation compares elements at extraction time. This approach facilitates insertion, as new elements can be added to the end of the queue without comparison"
". However, extracting the element with the highest priority requires comparing all elements in the queue. The diagram shows the same queue as in the first implementation, but this time the elements are not ordered by priority"

We see a tree with nodes containing numbers. The root node is a one. Its children are a three and a four. The three has children two and five. The four has children six and nine. The two has children eight and seven
". The two has children eight and seven. This is not a heap because some children have keys lower than those of the parent. For example, node two has a lower value than its parent, node three."
"Example 3









Heap

A diagram shows a binary tree labeled heap. The nodes of the tree contain the following values: 1 at the root, 2 and 4 on the second level, 3, 5, 6, and 9 on the third level, and 8 and 7 on the fourth level."

"Below the tree, we see a sequence-based representation of the tree. The sequence contains the numbers from 1 to 7.

- x.left is the left child of node x
- x.right is the right child of node x"

"What is testing?
- Finding the largest number of errors in a program
- Watch out! It is not convincing oneself that the program is correct...
- Testing is searching for errors **on purpose**
- The aim is to detect errors
Debugging"
"- The aim is to detect errors
Debugging
- Identifying and removing ""bugs"" on software

"The perfect test in impossible
Ideally, we should test the program in all possible situations.
It is impossible from any point of view: human, economic, and mathematical, due to infinite loops.
There is a huge number of combinations."

"The first category, unit testing, is further divided into two subcategories: white-box testing, also called structural testing, and black-box testing, also called functional testing."
"White-box testing includes method coverage, line or instruction coverage, and branch, condition, and loop coverage.
Black-box testing includes requirement coverage."

White-box testing"
"White-box testing
 about  and more specifically about White-box testing.
White-box testing is also called glass-box testing, transparent-box testing, or structural testing.
The aim of White-box testing is to thoroughly test the code structure."
"Coverage is a measure of the percentage of code that has been tested or ""covered"" with the tests.
There are different types of coverage: Method coverage, Line/Instruction coverage, and Branch/Condition/Loop coverage."
"Finally,  EclEmma, a tool integrated in Eclipse, that provides Code coverage.
White-box testing example
We see an example of unit testing using a white-box testing approach."
"On the left side, we have a code snippet showing a class named ""Calculator"" written in Java. This class contains three static methods:
- ""add"" which takes two integers as input and returns their sum."
"- ""max"" which takes two integers and returns the larger of the two.
- ""fac"" which calculates the factorial of an integer. It includes a check for non-negative input and throws an exception if the input is invalid."
"On the right side, we have another code snippet, this time showing a ""CalculatorTest"" class, also written in Java. This class is designed to test the functionality of the ""Calculator"" class using the JUnit 5 framework."
"The ""CalculatorTest"" class includes three test methods:
- ""testAdd"" which tests the ""add"" method of the Calculator class.
- ""testMax"" which tests the ""max"" method of the Calculator class.
- ""testFac"" which tests the ""fac"" method of the Calculator class."
Each test method uses assertions from the JUnit framework to verify that the output of the tested method matches the expected result.
"Below the code snippets, there is a window displaying the test results. It shows that three tests were run, and all of them passed successfully."
"Finally, at the bottom of the image, there is a caption that reads: ""Test class using JUnit 5 (Jupiter)"" confirming the testing framework used."
"The image also highlights different parts of the code in green, yellow, and red. This color-coding represents the code coverage achieved by the tests:
- Green: indicates lines of code that were fully covered and executed during the tests."
"- Yellow: indicates lines of code that were partially covered, meaning some branches or conditions within those lines were not tested.
- Red: indicates lines of code that were not covered at all by the tests."
"In the context of this example, the color-coding helps visualize how effectively the test cases are exercising the code in the ""Calculator"" class.

White-box testing example"
"White-box testing example
Line/Instruction coverage"
"A line of code can include several instructions for example: f equals f multiply i, in parenthesis multiplication and assignment. We do not normally pass through all the lines or instructions, only through most of them, but choosing wisely"
". Example: Lines covered, green and yellow, versus lines not covered, red."
"There are two tables. The first table shows line coverage for a Java class named Calculator. The overall coverage is 69.2%. The class has four methods: max, fac, add, and an unnamed constructor. The constructor has 100% coverage, add has 100%, fac has 83"
". The constructor has 100% coverage, add has 100%, fac has 83.3%, max has 40%, and the unnamed constructor has 69.2%."
"The second table shows instruction coverage for the same Calculator class. The overall instruction coverage is 71.4%. The constructor has 100% coverage, add has 100%, fac has 78.3%, max has 41.7%, and the unnamed constructor has 71.4%."

 about branch, condition, and loop coverage in white-box testing. It lists the following points:
- Testing all possible paths in branches
- Testing every condition (when it is true and false)"
"- Testing every condition (when it is true and false)
- Testing every loop (entering and not entering the loop)
  - for loop is safer than while and do-while
- Testing all possible program exit and decision points (including exceptions)"

"The ""testFac"" method tests the ""fac"" method of the ""Calculator"" class. It first asserts that calling ""fac"" with an input value of 3 returns the expected factorial value of 6"
". Then, it uses the ""assertThrows"" method to assert that calling ""fac"" with an invalid input value of -1 throws a ""NumberFormatException"". It further verifies that the exception message is ""invalid number""."

"The ""fac"" method takes an integer argument and calculates its factorial. It includes a condition to handle invalid input values less than or equal to 0 by throwing a ""NumberFormatException"" with the message ""invalid number""."
"At the bottom of the image, there is a caption that reads: ""Test class using JUnit 5 (Jupiter) **Calculator.fac(-1); fails as it is expected"""

White-box testing
What to do in real life?"
"White-box testing
What to do in real life?
- Testing 100% of the methods
- Approaching 100% of line/instruction coverage
- Reaching a good branch/condition/loop coverage
- The coverage depends on the type of program:"
"- The coverage depends on the type of program:
  - Games: enough with 60-80% code coverage
  - Critical software (health, nuclear power plants, military, etc.) >90%
  - The code coverage required grows with the distribution degree of the program"
"- White-box testing is usually supported by specific tools (e.g., EclEmma + JUnit)
White-box testing
Limitations
- White-box testing checks the **structure**, but not the functionality of the program"
"- A program can be correctly structured, but not working according to the functionality that was expected (it does correctly what it does, but it does not what we wanted)
- We need to test the functionality with black-box testing
Black-box testing"
"Black-box testing
 about black-box testing, also known as functional testing, behavioral testing, input/output testing, or data-driven testing."
The aim of black-box testing is to test the functionality of the code. Testers try to find cases in which the module does not fulfill its specification. Black-box testing is particularly important in modules that will be the interface with the end-user.
Black-box testing
"Requirement coverage: number of requirements that were tested. The problem: the set of data tends to be very large. Solution: ""Equivalence classes"". Equivalence classes are disjoint sets of possible data"
". Equivalence classes are disjoint sets of possible data. Note: they are not to be confused with Java ""Classes"""
". Note: they are not to be confused with Java ""Classes"". Some tricks to identify them are: below, in, and above the range, below, in, and above a specific value, in and out the set, true or false, and the same criteria for output data."
"Black-box testing
 the concept of equivalence classes and boundary values in the context of black-box testing.
We have an example of an integer used to identify the day of the month, with possible values ranging from 1 to 31."
"From this, we can define three equivalence classes: numbers below 1, numbers between 1 and 31, and numbers above 31."
"the importance of paying attention to singular values and choosing one value from each equivalence class for testing, avoiding boundary values.
Finally, it emphasizes the need to test boundary values, which are 1 and 31 in this case.
Black-box testing"
"Black-box testing
 about the limitations of black-box testing."
"Black-box testing tests the functionality of a program, meaning it checks if the program does what is expected. However, it does not check if the program does other things as well, such as containing a virus or malware"
". Therefore, black-box testing is not enough to ensure the quality of a program."

White-box testing is also called glass-box testing, transparent-box testing, or structural testing.
The aim of White-box testing is to thoroughly test the code structure."

"On the left side, we have a code snippet showing a class named ""Calculator"" written in Java. This class contains three static methods:
- ""add"" which takes two integers as input and returns their sum."
"- ""max"" which takes two integers and returns the larger of the two.
- ""fac"" which calculates the factorial of an integer. It includes a check for non-negative input and throws an exception if the input is invalid."

"the importance of paying attention to singular values and choosing one value from each equivalence class for testing, avoiding boundary values.
Finally, it emphasizes the need to test boundary values, which are 1 and 31 in this case.
Black-box testing"
"Black-box testing
 about the limitations of black-box testing."
"Black-box testing tests the functionality of a program, meaning it checks if the program does what is expected. However, it does not check if the program does other things as well, such as containing a virus or malware"
". Therefore, black-box testing is not enough to ensure the quality of a program."
Exercise 2
"• We program a method that calculates the quadrant to whichan object of class Point, received as argument, belongs.The object of class Point has two attributes of typedouble, which indicate the x and y coordinates"
". Think ofthe pairs of coordinates (x,y) that the objects of class Pointshould have in the black-box testing. How many pairs ofcoordinates must be used at least to test that the functionalityis correct?"
"We are programming a method that, given a point as an argument, calculates the quadrant to which the point belongs. The point is defined by its x and y coordinates, which are double-precision floating-point numbers"
. The question is: how many pairs of coordinates must be used at least to test that the functionality is correct?
"The image shows a coordinate system with four quadrants. The first quadrant is the upper right quadrant, the second quadrant is the upper left quadrant, the third quadrant is the lower left quadrant, and the fourth quadrant is the lower right quadrant."
"To test the functionality of the method, we need to provide at least one point in each quadrant. This means that we need at least four pairs of coordinates."
"Integration testing
• Several modules (methods, classes) are
involved
• They can be structural or functional

between modules
⎻ Functional: like black-box tests, but checking joint
functionalities"

"Some design approaches
There are three approaches to integration testing: top-down, bottom-up, and incremental coding."
Top-down testing starts by testing the most general modules first. The advantage of this approach is that it allows you to think of the whole functionality of the system from the beginning
". The disadvantage is that specific modules may not be ready yet, which can delay testing."
Bottom-up testing starts by testing the base modules first. The advantage of this approach is that there is no need for building artificial modules. The disadvantage is that it can be more focused on the development than in the client's expectations.
"Incremental coding is a technique where only the parts of the program needed for each functionality are coded. Once those parts are tested, more functionalities are added"
". Once those parts are tested, more functionalities are added. The advantage of this approach is that it allows for a lot of interaction with the user. The disadvantage is that complete modules are not ready until the end of the process."

"- ""Soft"" tests are useless.
- A case test includes the purpose of the test, the steps to run the test and the expected result

"• Tests should be designed and run by a different team that of
which wrote the code
• We shall not wait until the whole code is written to start the tests
• If tests reveal several errors in a module, we must insist on it"
"• If tests reveal many error in a module, we should discard it, and
redesign and program it from scratch
• Test can find errors, but can never prove that there are not
• Test can also contain errors"

"To address this, we need an additional test case: Look for the character 'k' in the array {'l'}. This test case must return false."
"Practical case
Robustness testing
• We could also have robustness tests:
⎻ What if we go over the 10,000 limit in the array?
⎻ What if the array was disordered?"
"We have to develop a test plan for the following method: public boolean search, that receives as input char what and char array where. The method returns true if what is in where, and false otherwise."
"We need to identify equivalence classes. The what is poorly specified. For the where, there is no information on the dimensions of the array or in the ordering criteria. What the method returns is clear"
". What the method returns is clear. First of all, we need to clarify these points in the specification of the problem."
"We are looking at a new version of a specification for a Java method called ""search"". The method takes two arguments: a character called ""what"" and an array of characters called ""where"""
". The specification states that any 8-bit character that can be represented in a Java program is valid for the ""what"" argument. The ""where"" array can have between 0 and 10,000 characters and must be sorted alphabetically in ascending order"
". Any string of characters is admissible for the ""where"" argument. The method returns true if the ""what"" character is present in the ""where"" array, and false otherwise."
"We can identify the following equivalence classes:- What: any character
- Where: an empty array, an array between 1 and 10,000 elements sorted, an array between 1 and 10,000 elements unsorted
- Result: true or false"
"- Result: true or false
We might consider singular combinations of input data, for example that the character to look for is the first or the last in the array.
Black-box testing
Black-box testing: Regular values"
"We have two test cases. The first one is: look for the character 'k' in the array 'a', 'b', 'c'. This test must return false.The second test case is: look for the character 'k' in the array 'j', 'k', 'l'. This test must return true.
White-box testing"
"White-box testing
We need an additional case for white-box testing to achieve 100% code coverage of lines, instructions, and branches."
"If we run the aforementioned tests and mark the lines and branches that we traverse, we will see that only the branch ""else z = m - 1;"" has not been tested."
"To address this, we need an additional test case: Look for the character 'k' in the array {'l'}. This test case must return false."

"Psychological and organizational aspects of testing...
- Testing is meant to find errors in a program, not to demonstrate that it works.
- A test is considered successful when it finds a bug."
"- A test is considered successful when it finds a bug.
- Tests should be designed and run by a team different from the one that wrote the code.
- Testing should not wait until all the code is written."
"- Testing should not wait until all the code is written.
- If several errors are found in a module, it's crucial to insist on fixing them.
- If many errors are found in a module, it's best to discard it and start over with the design and programming."
"- While tests can find errors, they can never definitively prove that there are no errors.
- It's important to remember that tests themselves can also contain errors."
"Practical case Black-box testing
The image shows a slide titled ""Practical case Black-box testing"".  on black-box testing with boundary values. It lists six test cases for finding the character 'k' in different arrays."
"- The first test case suggests looking for 'k' in an empty array, which should return false.
- The second test case suggests looking for 'k' in an array containing only 'k', which should return true."
"- The third test case suggests looking for 'k' in an array containing only 'c', which should return false.
- The fourth test case suggests looking for 'k' in an array containing 'k' and 'l', which should return true."
"- The fifth test case suggests looking for 'k' in an array containing 'j' and 'k', which should return true.
- The sixth test case suggests looking for 'k' in an array of 10,000 'a's, which should return false."
by stating that the order of the array is not considered in these test cases.
**Practical case White-box testing**
"The image shows a code snippet of a search function in Java. The code is used to illustrate the concept of white-box testing, which requires looking at the code to design test cases. The code implements a binary search algorithm"
". The code implements a binary search algorithm.The function takes two arguments: a character to search for (what) and a character array to search in (where). The function returns true if the character is found in the array, and false otherwise."
"The code starts by initializing three integer variables: a, z, and m. The variable a is initialized to 0, z is initialized to the length of the array minus 1, and m is initialized to the middle index of the array."
"The code then enters a while loop that continues as long as the value of a is less than or equal to the value of z. Inside the loop, the code calculates the middle index of the array and stores it in the variable m"
". The code then checks if the character at the middle index of the array is equal to the character being searched for. If it is, the function returns true."
"If the character at the middle index of the array is not equal to the character being searched for, the code checks if the character at the middle index is less than the character being searched for"
". If it is, the value of a is set to the middle index plus 1. Otherwise, the value of z is set to the middle index minus 1."
"The loop continues until the value of a is greater than the value of z. At this point, the function returns false."
The comment on the right side of the image emphasizes that white-box testing requires understanding the internal workings of the code to design effective test cases.
**Formalization of test set (9 tests)**
"We have a list of nine tests for the function ""search"". Each test consists of a call to the function with different inputs and a message that will be printed to the standard output depending on the result of the function."
The first test checks if the function returns false when the second argument is an empty set. The second test checks if the function returns true when the second argument contains the element we are looking for
. The third test checks if the function returns false when the second argument does not contain the element we are looking for
. The fourth test checks if the function returns true when the second argument contains the element we are looking for and another element
. The fifth test checks if the function returns true when the second argument contains the element we are looking for and two other elements
. The sixth test checks if the function returns true when the second argument contains the element we are looking for repeated four times
. The seventh test checks if the function returns false when the second argument contains three different elements but not the one we are looking for
. The eighth test checks if the function returns true when the second argument contains the element we are looking for and two other elements
. The ninth test checks if the function returns true when the second argument contains only the element we are looking for.
"**Practical case JUnit Test Cases**
We see a code snippet showing a JUnit test class named ""SearchTest"".
The class starts by declaring a variable ""s"" of type ""Search"" and initializing it with a new ""Search"" object."
"The code then defines nine test methods: ""test1"" through ""test9"". Each test method is annotated with ""@Test"" and calls the ""search"" method of the ""Search"" class with different input parameters"
". The ""search"" method seems to take a character and an array of characters as input."
"The test methods use assertions to verify the expected outcome of the ""search"" method. For example, ""test1"" asserts that the ""search"" method should return false when searching for the character 'k' in an empty array"
". Similarly, ""test2"" asserts that the ""search"" method should return true when searching for the character 'k' in an array containing only the character 'k'."
"The ""test6"" method creates a large array of characters filled with the character 'a' and asserts that the ""search"" method should return false when searching for the character 'k' in this array."
"The remaining test methods (""test7"" to ""test9"") continue to test the ""search"" method with different input parameters and assertions to ensure its correctness."
Practical case JUnit Test Cases
The image shows the code and the result of running some JUnit test cases for that code. The code is a simple search algorithm that takes two arguments: a character to search for and an array of characters to search in
". The algorithm returns true if the character is found in the array, and false otherwise."
The test results show that all nine test cases passed and that the code coverage is 100%. This means that all lines of code in the search algorithm were executed by at least one test case.
"**Practical case Robustness testing**
We could also have robustness tests:
- What if we go over the 10,000 limit in the array?
- What if the array was disordered?"
