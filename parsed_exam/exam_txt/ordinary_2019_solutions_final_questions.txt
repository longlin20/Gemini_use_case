Problem 1 (2 p oints ) 
We want to develop an app for a sport event that allows printing the lists of volunteers with their 
identification number, the assigned position in the event ( "press" , "floaters" , "ticketing" , "grandstand" , 
"protocol" ), their shift (morning “ Shift: M ” or afternoon “ Shift: A ”) and their personal data: age, gender and 
identification number (ID), as it is shown below:  
 
Volunteer number: 1, Position: press, Shift: M, Age: 24, Gender: F, ID: 00000001 -R 
Volunteer number: 2, Position: grandstand, Shift: M, Age: 56, Gender: F, ID: 00000002 -W 
Volunteer number: 3, Position: ticketing, Shift: A, Age: 43, Gender: M, ID: 00000003 -A 
 
Moreove r, volunteers receive a lunch ticket if they go to the event in the morning shift , and they receive a 
dinner ticket if they go to the event in the afternoon shift. Volunteers in the ticketing  position (those who 
sell tickets) cannot receive dinner ticket s because the ticket office closes at 18:00. For this app, you are 
given the following  code : 
● The code of the class  Person , which models the personal information of the volunteers (age, 
gender and id).  
● Interface  Position , which declares the method  selectPosition (). This method returns a 
String with the assigned position of the volunteer . 
 
public class Person {  
  private int age; 
  private char gender; 
  private String id; 
  public Person(int age, char gender, String id) { 
    this.age = age; 
    this.gender = gender; 
    this.id = id; 
  } 
  public String toString() {  
    return "Age: " + age + ", Gender: "  + gender +  
      ", ID: "  + id; 
   } 
} public interface  Position {  
  
String[] positions  =  
{"press", "floaters" , "ticketing" , 
"grandstand", "protocol" }; 
  
String selectPosition();  
} 
 
Section  1 (0.2 puntos)  
Declare the interface  TicketPrinter  and its method  restaurantTickets( ). This method does 
not receive any argument, returns a String , and may throw the exception  TicketException  .  
 
 

Section 2 (1.5 puntos)  
Implement the class  Volunteer , which inherits from the class  Person  and implements the interfaces  
Position  and TicketPrinter . Moreover, this class contains the attributes and methods needed to 
model the state and behavior of a volunteer. In order to implement this class, you are asked to do the 
following things:   
(A) Declare  4 attributes  that are not accessible  from any other cl ass, and  2 constant s that can be accessed 
from any other class. These attributes  and constants are : 
● numTotal : Integer number ( int) whose in itial value is 1 and is incremented each time a new 
volunteer is registered. This value is shared by all the created volunteers . 
● numVolunteer : Integer number ( int) whose value is assigned in a consecutive way for each 
volunteer so that each volunteer has a different value of  numVolunteer . 
● position : Attribute of type String used to store the assigned position . 
● shift : Attribute of type char used to indicate the shift. It can take the value of the following 
constants . 
○ MORNING : It takes the value ‘M’ and represents the morning shift . 
○ AFTERNOON : It takes the value ‘A’ and represents the afternoon shift . 
(B) Implement  the method selectPosition()  of the interface  Position . This method assigns one 
of the five defined positions ( "press" , "floaters" , "ticketing" , "grandstand" , "protocol" ) to each volunteer 
in a random way . NOT E: In order to implement this method, you should make use of the random  and 
round  methods of class  Math , whose description is as follows : 
● public static double random()  // Returns a double value between [0,1]  
● public static long round(double a) // Returns the closest long to the 
argument, with ties rounding up  
(C) Implement  a constructor  of the class  Volunteer  which receives as parameters the age, gender, id 
and shift, and assigns the rest of the attributes taking into account the following consider ations : 
● It must correctly initialize the attributes  numTotal and numVolunteer . 
● In order to assign the position of the volunteer, you need to call the method selectPosition()  
that you implemented previously . 
● In order to initialize the attribute  shift , you need to check inside the constructor whether the 
value of the shift is correct. You can call the method  boolean checkParameter(char 
shift) of class Volunteer . If the value is correct, the attribute will be directly assigned. 
Otherwise, the attribute w ill be initialized with the default value ( MORNING o r ‘M’). NOT E: You 
do not need to implement the method  checkParameter . You can use directly and assume that 
it  is  correctly implemented and returns true if shift takes a valid value and false  otherwise.  
(D) Implem ent the  method toString()  which returns the information of the  volunteer using the  
following format : 
Volunteer number: <numVolunteer>, Position: <position>, Shift: <shift>, Age: <age>, Gender: 
<gender>, ID: <id>  
(E) Implement  the method  restaurantTickets () of the interface  TicketPrinter , which returns 
a String indicating the kind of restaurant ticket that each volunteer receives . For the case of volunteers with 
the morning shift, this method returns  “Lunch ticket”,  and for the case of the volunteers with the  afternoon 
shift, it returns  “Dinner ticket” . Furthermore, the method must throw an exception of type  
TicketException  with the error message  “Invalid shift”  if the position is ticketing  and the shift is 
afternoon  (because ticket office closes at 18:00 and these volunteers do not get  dinner ticket s). NOT E: You 
do not need to implement the class  TicketException . You can use it assuming  that it is correctly 
implemented .  
  
 
 

Section  3 (0.3 points ) 
Complete the code of the method  main()  in class  PrintVolunteerLis t. This method prints the  list 
of volunteers and prints the corresponding restaurant tickets using the method  restaurantTickets() . 
public class PrintVolunteerList {  
 
 public static void main(String[] args) { 
              Volunteer v1 = new Volunteer(24, 'F', "00000001 -R", Volunteer. MORNING); 
              Volunteer v2 = new Volunteer(56, 'F', "00000002 -W", Volunteer. AFTERNOON ); 
              Volunteer v3 = new Volunteer(43, 'M', "00000003 -A", Volunteer. AFTERNOON ); 
    
  ArrayList<Volunteer> volunteers  = new ArrayList<Volunteer>();  
  volunteers .add(v1); 
  volunteers .add(v2); 
  volunteers .add(v3); 
 
              // SECTION 3. COMPLET E 
} 
Problem 2 (2 puntos)  
You are given the classes  MyBasicLinkedList<E>  and Node<E> , which have the following already 
implemented methods : 
public class MyBasicLinkedList<E> {  
   private Node<E> first; 
   public void setFirst(Node<E> first){...}       
   public Node<E> getFirst(){...}   
   public boolean isEmpty(){...}    
   public void insert(E info){...}  
   public E extract(){...}          
   public int size(){...}           
   public int numberOfOccurrences(E info){...}  
   public MyBasicLinkedList<E> intersection  
   (MyBasicLinkedList<E> list2 ){//SECTION 2} 
} public class Node<E> {  
   private E info; 
   private Node<E> next; 
   public Node(E info){this.info = info;}  
   public E getInfo(){...}    
   public Node<E> getNext(){...}    
   public void setInfo(E info){...}    
   public void setNext(Node<E> next){...}    
} 
Section  1 (0.25 points ) 
Program the class  MyBasicLinkedListException , which inherits from class  Exception  and 
simply has a constructor which receives a message of type  String . 
Section  2 (1.75 points) 
Implement the method  public MyBasicLinkedList<E> intersection(MyBasicLinkedList<E> 
list2) throws MyBasicLinkedListException  
The signature  of the method must be strictly followed in the solution of the exercise. This method receives 
and object of class  MyBasicLinkedList<E>  and returns a list whose elements are the result of the 
intersection between the two lists (i.e., the common elements) . In the resulting list, it does not matter  the 
order of the elements, but the list cannot contain repeated elements .  
You are recommended to use the method  numberOfOccurrences of class MyBasicLinkedList 
(this method returns the number of times info  is in the list ). You can assume  that the method is correctly 
implemented. Moreover, the rest of the method s from both classes, except  for intersection , are 
already correctly implemented and you can use them if n eeded.   
As an example, if you have the following lists (L1 and L2) and the information is numeric : 
L1: 1 2 3 
L2: 4 3 5 2 6 2 3 3 2 
 
 

The result of the method would be the following list:  2 3. The list with elements  3 2 would also be  valid 
as the order of elements in the resulting list does not matter . 
In addition, the method must throw the exception  MyBasicLinkedListException  if the list to be 
returned is empty . Furthermore, the original lists must preserve the elements they contain (in the same 
order) after the execution of the method.  
Problem 3 (2 p oints ) 
For this problem, you are given the interface  BTree<E>  and classes  LBNode<E>  and LBTree<E> , 
which model a binary tree . Moreover, you are given the class  BinaryTreeExample , which has a  main  
method and a method called  sumEvenNumbers.  
NOTE : There are not exceptions in the implementation given . 
public interface  BTree<E> {  
  static final int LEFT = 0; 
  static final int RIGHT = 1; 
 
  boolean isEmpty();  
  E getInfo();  
  BTree<E> getLeft();  
  BTree<E> getRight();  
  void insert(BTree<E> tree, int side) 
  BTree<E> extract( int side); 
 
  String toStringPreOrder();  
  String toStringInOrder();  
  String toStringPostOrder();  
  String toString();  
 
  int size(); 
  int height();  
  boolean equals(BTree<E> tree); 
  boolean find(BTree<E> tree); 
} class LBNode<E> {  
  private E info; 
  private BTree<E> left; 
  private BTree<E> right; 
  
  LBNode(E info, BTree<E> left, BTree<E> right) { 
    this.left = left; 
    this.right = right; 
    this.info = info; 
   } 
 
   E getInfo() { return info;} 
   void setInfo(E info) {this.info = info;} 
 
   BTree<E> getLeft() {  return left; } 
   void setLeft(BTree<E> left) {this.left = left;} 
 
   BTree<E> getRight() { return right;} 
   void setRight(BTree<E> right) {this.right = right;} 
} 
public class LBTree<E> implements  
BTree<E>{  
  private LBNode<E> root;  
  public LBTree() {  
    root = null; 
  } 
  public LBTree(E info) {  
    root = new LBNode<E>(info,  
           new LBTree<E>(),  
           new LBTree<E>());  
  } 
  ...  
} public class BinaryTreeExample {  
   public static void main(String args[]) { 
        BTree<Integer> n1 = new LBTree<Integer>(1);  
        BTree<Integer> n2 = new LBTree<Integer>(2);  
        BTree<Integer> n3 = new LBTree<Integer>(3);  
        BTree<Integer> n4 = new LBTree<Integer>(4);  
        BTree<Integer> n5 = new LBTree<Integer>(5);  
        BTree<Integer> n6 = new LBTree<Integer>(6);  
   
        // SECTION 1: Requested code must be written after 
this comment . 
    
        System. out.println( "Sum even numbers = "  +  
                           sumEvenNumbers (n4));  
    } 
    public static int sumEvenNumbers(BTree<Integer> tree){  
// SECTION 3  } 
} 
Section  1 (0.5 points ) 
Complete  the method  main  from class  BinaryTreeExample  to create the following binary tree  (see 
next page ), which  stores information of type  Integer , from the created nodes in the code given. You 
must use the methods from the abovementioned classes .  
Section  2 (0.3 points ) 
Given the binary tree provided in Section 1 , indica te the sequences of pre -order, in -order and post -order 
traversals of the tree.  
  
 
 

Section  3 (1.2 points ) 
Implement  the method  sumEvenNumbers  of class  BinaryTreeExample , which sums the value of 
the nodes whose value is even. This method must be implemented in a recursive way . Any other 
implementation will not be graded.  
NOTE : The sequence  System. out.println( "Sum even numbers = "  + sumEvenNumbers (n4));  
must print the following result (when applied to the example tree) : 
Sum even numbers = 
Problem 4 (1 point ) 
Given the following code : 
import java.util.ArrayList;  
public class BubbleSort {   
public static void main(String[] args){ 
 ArrayList<Integer> a = new ArrayList<Integer>();  
 a.add(2);  
 a.add(5);  
 a.add(4);  
 a.add(6);  
 a.add(8);  
 a.add(3);  
 a.add(1);  
 a.add(9);  
 a.add(7);  
 System. out.println( "Elements before sorting: " ); 
 System. out.println( a); 
 System. out.println( "Elements After sorting (in Descending order): " ); 
 bubbleSort (a); 
 System. out.println( a);} 
} 
 
Implement  the method  bubbleSort  (it does not return anything and it must be static ) to sort the ArrayList 
in descending  order . 
Example:  
Elements before sorting:  
[2, 5, 4, 6, 8, 3, 1, 9, 7]  
Elements After sorting (in Descending order):  
[9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
